3. As a seasoned network engineer with almost two decades of experience in IT industry, I'm interested in further strengthening my knowledge by adding development skills into my arsenal. With the introduction of **SDN**, everything is slowly moving to the programming world and network engineers also have to adapt to that. Meanwhile this knowledge can be used for daily tasks like network automation, log parsing, various metric gathering etc. Primary area of interest is back end development / **Node.js.** and maybe integrating some basic front end functionality into neat electron instance.
4. I have a basic knowledge of customizing already available source code for my needs using:
* _PHP_
* _LUA_
* _TCL_
5. Wrote small JS code using TCPDF library, that converts input text from several fields into PDF documents with custom header/footer and formatting/colors. Also modified some plugins/addons written LUA for several games and wrote couple myself. Earlier used to use rudimentary automation scripts using PHP and TCL.
6. No working experience as a developer. Otherwise been managing network and open source systems for many years.
7. No particular education in development field. Only some minor udemy courses.
8. Years of study of technical documentation, manuals, RFCs and scrutinizing tons of logs and debug outputs made me quite fluent in English, especially in technical terminology.
